### Hi there!  Welcome to my little corner of GitHub.

Programming has been my career since 2008. I've actually been programming since about 1995 when I discovered the `QBASIC` command in the DOS 5 manual. After going through much of the online docs, I needed to know more about what I had ran into. My school's library and discovered some outdated books on programming and robotics, so I checked out every book I could find. I had a 'Eureka!' moment when I realized I could write apps in Basic in MS Office. A book on building and programming robots found its way in front of me at a local electronic parts store my dad frequented. A quarterly magazine on web development popped-up at another local store while I accompanyied my mom shopping. Inside, it talked about CSS, HTML, and VBScript. Eventually, I read books on C++ and video game programming. My knowledge branched out as I learned Java, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Scala, and whatever else was out there. I figured that learning everything about the different styles of programming and history of programming languages couldn't hurt. Now, [you can read more about my thoughts on programming on my website](https://adaburrows.com/docs/nkp/introduction/).

Currently, I'm working on the [REA Playspace](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/rea-playspace) with [Lightningrod Labs](https://lightningrodlabs.org/). It's part time, so I still have some time to spare for other paying projects. If you need something built and can fund building it, don't be afraid to reach out to me and ask how I could help you make something a reality.
